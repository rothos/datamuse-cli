## Future features

The Datamuse API supports queries involving a spelling filter alongside other
parameters, for instance "words that have a similar meaning to 'point' and have
'o' as the third letter":

[https://api.datamuse.com/words?ml=point&sp=??o*]()

Currently, the `datamuse-cli` tool does not support this feature.
